### 1. About Trustlet
Trustlet is a platform that connects hosts and guests. Trustlet itself does not manage properties, act as a host, or provide accommodations.

### 2. Responsibilities
- **Hosts** are solely responsible for the accuracy of their listings, compliance with local laws (including leases, subletting, and taxes), and the safety of their guests.  
- **Guests** are solely responsible for their behavior, agreements made with hosts, and compliance with host rules.  
- Trustlet does not verify, endorse, or guarantee the conduct of users.

### 3. Liability
Trustlet is not liable for disputes, damages, accidents, cancellations, or any issues that arise between hosts and guests.  
The platform is provided “as is” during beta.

### 4. User Accounts
By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate information.  
Trustlet may suspend accounts that violate these Terms.

### 5. Changes
We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the service after changes means you accept the new Terms.
